            <p>“We used ELSOL's Moodle based CPD Learning and Tracking system for over four years. Recently they proposed and helped us migrate to a generic system solution that continues to meet both our requirements for CPD tracking in line with insurance regulation and our plans for personnel development through competency and performance management capabilities. I have been very happy with their support service, professionalism and easy to work with manner. I highly recommend ELSOL!.”</p>
